# MULTIBALE-AI-AGENTES

Expected Output
The script will output a comprehensive pathology report based on the input clinical data. The report includes sections such as:

Clinical Data: Description of the patient’s medical history, presenting symptoms, and relevant findings.
Gross Examination: Details of the specimen’s appearance, size, and notable features.
Microscopic Features: Analysis of histopathological findings.
Diagnosis: Primary and secondary diagnoses, including grading and staging.
Comments: Explanation and differential diagnoses.
Recommendations: Suggested further investigations, including immunohistochemical stains.
5. Customization
This framework is designed to be easily extensible. You can customize the workflow by:

Modifying the clinical case input for other pathology cases.
Adding new features or tools to extend the report's capabilities.
Updating the agent descriptions for different types of pathology.
Tests
Unit tests for various components are provided in the tests directory. These tests ensure the correct functionality of the research and writing agents, as well as the main workflow.
